  <div data-question-two hidden>
              <p data-question-two>Square Every Digit</p>
              <p data-question-two>For Example 9119 would return 811181 because 9^2 = 81, and 1^2 = 1</h3>
              <p data-question-two>Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer</p>

  </div>
  <div data-question-four hidden>
                <p data-question-four>An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.
              
                Example:
                
                The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
                The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
                Your function should return the int 5.
                If no number was deleted from the array and no difference with it, your function should return the int 0.
                
                Note that N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []).</p>

      </div>
      <div data-question-one hidden>
              <p data-question-one>Add the isUpperCase method to String to see whether the string is ALL CAPS. For example:</p>
              <p data-question-one>"c".isUpperCase() == false
                  "C".isUpperCase() == true
                  "hello I AM DONALD".isUpperCase() == false
                  "HELLO I AM DONALD".isUpperCase() == true
                  "ACSKLDFJSgSKLDFJSKLDFJ".isUpperCase() == false
                  "ACSKLDFJSGSKLDFJSKLDFJ".isUpperCase() == true</p>
                  <p data-question-one>Corner Cases

                    
                    For simplicity, you will not be tested on the ability to handle corner cases (e.g. "%*&#()%&^#" or similar strings containing alphabetical characters at all) - an ALL CAPS (uppercase) string will simply be defined as one containing no lowercase letters. Therefore, according to this definition, strings with no alphabetical characters (like the one above) should return True.</p>
                    
       </div>
       <div data-question-three hidden>
                <p data-question-three>Complete the solution so that it returns a formatted string. The return value should equal "Value is VALUE" where value is a 5 digit padded number.</p>
                <p data-question-three>solution(5) // should return "Value is 00005"</p>
